        Ghosting the classroom for an hour, munched on Domino’s, and felt the air less noisy than usual and rather more peaceful. Everything was alright, and I had my chocolate bar in 2 days and checked on my friends.<br>
        “Order one chicken biryani for Vani.” Priyanka texted me, and I sighed seeing the long line. I headed to the side of the line, looking for that familiar, usual smug person whom I believed I knew, to help me get her lunch.<br>
        “Get me one chicken biryani, I’ll pay you,” I spoke to the nodding head, smug.<br>
        The duo arrived, and Abhi, a friend of mine all this time, followed the path of MH370. He suddenly vanished after I completed my Dairy Milk Smooth.<br>
        “Priyanka is doing a course.” Vani cut me off, “Where’s my food? Whom do I pay? I’m not paying you.” She jokes around.<br>
        And the smug came in hefty steps, carrying food for a total of three people, and I stuck the money into his pocket. Finding a table, the duo & I took a seat under the shade of the tree.<br>
        ---<br>
        “What course are you doing?” I asked Priyanka.<br>
        The duo did something weird, and I grew impatient.<br>
        “What course, yoo?” I insisted again.<br>
        She placed her phone on the table, swallowed the food, and spoke, “I got an appointment today.”<br>
        “Appointment for?” I asked.<br>
        “PES.” She announced.<br>
        “What’s PES?” I felt dumb, watching them eat and feel hungry again.<br>
        “It’s a university.” Vani jumped on her seat, yelling the word university loudly.<br>
        “You’re in Christ, right?” I spoke to her.<br>
        “Hey, Christ was like my second option. The mock exams are mostly accurate, and when I gave them, they showed that I can get into PES.” She uttered.<br>
        “Huh?” I spoke. “What do you mean?”<br>
        “I have an appointment at 7 today for counselling. If I pass it, I’ll get into PES.” She continued.<br>
        “What about Christ and us?” I spoke louder than usual, pointing at Vani and me.<br>
        “I don’t know… That’s what I’m thinking about.” She spoke, continuing to eat.<br>
        I grew silent. It couldn’t be another good friend, I thought to myself.<br>
        We moved onto another table after Vani and a tiny spider scared each other off.<br>
        However, nothing made me overthink it, except her idea of joining PES.<br>
        “But one semester in Christ is over, right? It’s like you’re going one semester back.” I spoke to her.<br>
        “Aree…” She sang, “I know, but it's like my main option, and I might even get in.” She spoke.<br>
        “Don’t get it.” I secretly wished.<br>
        No offense at her leaving, even if there was, but why spend one entire semester and leave to another place where the classes begin in two fortnights.<br>
        “I won’t be there on your birthday, Vani.” She claimed to Vani and I overheard the conversation, looking away silently.<br>
        I felt cursed.<br>
        Was I always cursed to lose my friends, especially the dearest?<br>
        I finally settled on a trio, and one knapsack had to make a departure, even though the indirect deal was for four years; that one semester sounded too short.<br>
        “But we’ll celebrate it outside somewhere.” She continued, “I’ll come here during any event over here; they let in other college students, right? We can celebrate it together.”<br>
        “Once you leave Christ, I assume the admission office will have your ID card and University Debit Card taken back.” I interrupted them, “That means no entry.”<br>
        “We can meet out somewhere.” She would say, “Not you.” to me, “Me and Anshika.”<br>
        I could understand it in some situations, because she had that overthinking mindset, and she thought her parents would deny her outing with her friends, especially when I (guy friend) was around during that outing.<br>
        I, meaning a boy of the human race factor. Sexist to a decent amount, but understandable for any typical South Indian girl with strict parents, or she might even overthink her parents as strict. Even though her parents were supportive, she had to overcome multiple instances of rejection and denial from them.<br>
        I had nothing to say to her.<br>
        I was already devastated.<br>
        The class after that was like Alice in Boreland, I didn’t have a good mood, combined with the poor sleep last night, it had to hit hard into my mental thoughts. And this had spread over time, like some viral infection, but into my thoughts.<br>
        ---<br>
        “Why are you so moody?” Vani asked me when Priyanka’s turn for mentoring began.<br>
        I lifted and dropped my shoulders, looking at her.<br>
        “Is it because she is leaving?” She asked.<br>
        I nodded slowly.<br>
        “Why don’t you do any emotional scenes out here?” I asked her.<br>
        “I yelled at her yesterday night, when she told me.” She replied.<br>
        “I was the last one to know,” I asked.<br>
        “What?” She yelled for a bit.<br>
        “Nothing.” I looked away.<br>
        Vani got out of class and walked straight to her hostel, without waiting for Priyanka’s bus, and I couldn’t have gone far.<br>
        I didn’t speak with her much.<br>
        “Hey, you don’t be like this, ah!” She spoke as we sat down.<br>
        “Meh?” I responded.<br>
        “And don’t say about this to anyone.” She uttered, “Only you and Vans know about this.”<br>
        It sounded nice when I was at the top of the list in knowing something that’s gonna happen, but proudly not about this topic.<br>
        She left for her bus, and I unintentionally ignored the canteen's smugness and came back to my room, feeling bad for not saying something properly to her.<br>
        The evening went by unknown, and I lost my motivation to pick up that book from my cupboard to do the assignment I had left incomplete.<br>
        ---<br>
        The next morning, I met with her friend, who smiled at me unusually, and she walked up to me, “I also told her about it.”<br>
        “Are your other friends dumb to laugh?” I would have asked instead I said, “Hmm.” giving the slightest of interest in the conversation.<br>
        “We’ll sit here…” She said, pointing to the concrete seating, but I insisted we head to class.<br>
        We sat outside the class when Vani came over, running late from her hostel.<br>
        “How are you, Arya?” Vani asked me.<br>
        I looked ‘Meh! on my face.<br>
        “PES is not that far.” I showed her, on the map, “It’s just a few metro stops from here.”<br>
        “You don’t see that anol.” She put my phone away. “I’m not going anywhere.” She responded.<br>
        “What?” I sounded.<br>
        “I’m not going to PES,” Priyanka revealed.<br>
        “What?” I sounded again.<br>
        “It was just a prank,” She revealed.<br>
        There you go, got fucking pranked again.<br>
        That was one more thing that I hadn’t done in a long time. Getting pranked. Not silly, but actually a real breathing prank.<br>
        “You’re not going.” I nodded happily.<br>
        The girls laughed, and Priyanka showed me her and Vani’s chats on pranking me with her old PES entrance exam ID Card.<br>
        At this point, I’m sure I didn’t complete reading the entire chat, because now I realize how foolish I was to believe someone so easily.<br>
        And god willing, it would take me a lot of time to accept that her Disappearing Act was more likely an illusion worth content to see my reaction.<br>
        And I was another moron who believed that.<br>
        ---<br>
        PS. Don’t believe anyone, even if it's not April Fools.<br>
        Trust me, it's gonna be [YOUR_NAME]’s Fool's Day then.<br>
