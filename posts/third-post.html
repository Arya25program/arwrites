      <p>
        I was making up the lighting in our apartment. The girls hanging out at our place to do a bit of a decoration so that the invitees don’t walk out calling it a New Year’s Office Meeting.
        <br>Amya, Sanjay, Priyanka, and the valuable writer in the room, had one job to invite an handful of kind people to finish the turkey stuffing and not make our huge apartment lonely at the end of the year. But it struck my mind, if we four had friends outside our circle.
        <br>What if outsiders come by as “friends”?
        <br>So, I opened my friend's list and gave a deep breath out as I started to call all the good people who don't vomit in parties and who doesn't cry or simp like a bear in need for his or her mommy and who doesn’t insult me with my office Call names in the party.
        <br>The other two guys and my girl also called some of theirs.
        <br>Now it was the arrangements. We called all of them and asked them (clears throat) ordered them to assemble at our apartment at sharp ten in the night.
        <br>One lame friend of mine from work, who writes poems for the newsletter, asked me if he should come in the day ten or night ten. And then he smiled for two straight minutes believing that he makes the jokes laughable with that laughter?
        <br>How could a person be so lame at cracking jokes and also be a poet on romance and emotions who sells like a person who never saw an unsold extra copy coming on his table?
        <br>Maybe I should write like him? Or act like him?
        <br>Or maybe I should stop thinking about him? And I’m out of people to call.
        <br>I was sticking the lights on the wall.
        <br>Sanjay was writing thank-you-for-coming cards.
        <br>Amya was planning the events to be done.
        <br>Priyanka ordered the dinner, snacks and sweets to eat during the party, and constantly kept reassuring that she won’t drink the next year. Even though I constantly explained the night she made me debut drunk and accelerated her Dad’s hatchback into the police station.
        <br>The lights were set and it was decided to turn of the general lights off and turn on the temporary lights. Sanjay would give the cards whenever an attendee or if some kind of random intruder came in to attend the party, as he grew cold in the cold weather outside.
        <br>Amya would entertain all of us with the events, and games to be done for, after the untamed guests have arrived. And as the second last thing of this year, Priyanka would give the guests and me, dinner and sweets to eat.
        <br>At last we all would do a great countdown from whatsoever number to zero and say happy new year, jumping like a 10-year-old knowing that we are going another year older; apparently with a lot of joy
        <br>And why do we even jump about when we slogged the entire year doing crappy jobs and the earth took the effort to make a revolution, and still didn’t kick us off gravity?
        <br>But for a change, I decided that we all kiss off someone at zero-zero-zero-zero. How interesting it would be until, Sanjay kisses Priyanka and I kiss Amya or Amya kisses Priyanka and I, ended my year kissing off Sanjay instead of who I wanted to kiss.
        <br>The other three nodded a perfect and sweet, “Okay”. That wouldn’t be the case, if they got around my thoughts on who kisses whom.
        <br>Priyanka remembered and spoke that she would love to kiss that cute guy from her work, Antonio. Then, like how pigeons forget its own nest, Amya started to simp for Antonio who she won't be able to kiss. What kiss? Amya did not see Antonio for even once.
        <br>“Don't know if Antonio would get kissed but I am sure he would get slapped at the end of zero.” I mumbled in whisper.
        <br>Priyanka heard it and shouted, “What?” waving her hands apart.
        <br>“I am few centimeters away from you. Needn't have to shout like a goose.” I said whispering, “My ears.” I said so, walking away punching my index into my ears to reduce the pain on it.
        <br>“I would like to give a smelly hand of help to your good ears.” Sanjay exclaimed, pointing at me as he walking behind me as the girls got into deep whisper.
        <br>“What was that all about?” Sanjay asked, hitting my belly fat.
        <br>“I don't know... They both always simp on Antonio, who is first Italian, Christian, and a dumb flirtation kind of a kid.” I spoke.
        <br>“Hello. I am also a flirtation ship kind of a chick….” Sanjay reminded.
        <br>“Be kindly monkey. You’re in second of my list.” I declared.
        <br>The bell rang.
        <br>All eyes went towards the door.
        <br>Leaving the very source of our own existence, and chasing heart beats out of us as we wanted the anticipation to know who’s on the other side, to be on our face.
        <br>Cut to the chase.
        <br>We all ran towards the door. For four different latitude and longitudes of our door, glued the four of us. Who cares about the degree? We need to open the door first, and invite them.
        <br>“I caught the door handle first… So… According to newton’s third law, I shall open the door.” Sanjay shouted pushing the rest of us away from him and the door.
        <br>He cleared his throat, pulled open the door wide open.
        <br>A beautiful lady with a slight lipstick on her lips, from Amya's office came. I did not know that people like Amya would know people like the lady at our door, who look so damn.
        <br>“Don't look at her like that.” Amya whispered into my ears (heavenly god came to peace hearing her whisper).
        <br>I was on the side of the table. With my body is a melting state, wiggling my body as if I am boneless and melting at the sight of the lady. My eyes were with a lot of hope that I would kiss her. Hey! Woah! I am going to kiss this new chick, kill Antonio and marry Priyanka.
        <br>So good, are you?
        <br>Sanjay pulled out one card from his right pocket and handed it to the beautiful lady. The lady makes a gesture and accepts the card and she read what Sanjay wrote in it.
        <br>She smiled at him and winked at him in micro-macro seconds.
        <br>She walked into our apartment pushing Sanjay with her palm with a look that meant and allowed Sanjay to come 5x closer than before.
        <br>I quickly came back to my bone state, went towards her and rudely snatched the card from her hand.
        <br>This was because, I am a shy person. With a shy smile whenever I talk to a girl who looks really good. So just to avoid any kind of scene I just acted rudely.
        <br>I read the words in the card.
        <br>Amya and Priyanka stood by my two sides, leaning themselves on my either shoulder, to read what I was also reading with ultimate interest.
        <br>“Hmm...” Priyanka said.
        <br>“Classic...” Amya said.
        <br>“Teach me some of these cool lines.” I shouted and turned towards Sanjay.
        <br>Sanjay was kissing that girl right on her lips. The girl kept her hands over his shoulder, ran it around his top back and enjoyed the kiss, so passionately that the passion fruit company owner went to his grave, dig himself up to die.
        <br>I’m the passion fruit company owner by the way.
        <br>“Cover your eyes.” Amya whispered as she slowly brought her hand to my cover, she did not like me to stare at her colleague like that and face it, she was kissing.
        <br>I pushed her away in frustration.
        <br>I moved towards the sudden kisser.
        <br>I said to Sanjay as he still had his lips on hers, “It is not midnight yet for love of Shyam.”
        <br>He pushed me away in a jerk and continued kissing. He ran his right hand to her back lower waist and rested his left hand on her middle back, and turned his nose here and there, and what a disgusting scene it turned out.
        <br>I went back and stood in middle of Amya and Priyanka, who were seeing the kiss very seriously, like a soccer match’s final minute, when the game becomes so serious and exciting.
        <br>Little did I know that they were actually interested in all of these types of contents. 
        <br>“I am feelings things...” I spoke
        <br>Amya and Priyanka stared at me, giving me a dirty look.
        <br>“Hey, why you dirty-looking me?” I got furious and pointed at Sanjay, “He got his tongue in her intestine… Slap him…”
        <br>I looked at each other and smiled.
        <br>They left me alone and went to do their usual makeup.
        <br>I, a loner, a single boy looked at the kissers.
        <br>They stopped kissing. The girl hassled back and said, “You’re the kisser! See you after 12… Would the kisser be free any time then?” and she walked inside towards the girls and started mumbling with them.
        <br>“Nah! I got a date with you, to pick up…” Sanjay responded smoothing his hands off her back.
        <br>Sanjay came towards me walking slowly with his legs flying apart as he kept each leg forward.
        <br>“What kind of a glue did you stick on your lips?” I asked him sarcastically.
        <br>And the reply he gave me a reply.
        <br>“A glue that sticks between two lovers.” He spoke.
        <br>“You met her just now…” I hit him back on his belly.
        <br>“Yeah, but it was sudden and amazing with a lot of sync in us. Even if I don't know her, even if I don't want to see her again. That kiss would glue her to me always.” He used his mouth at me.
        <br>I flicked my fingers on his forehead and turned my eyeballs to the lady who sat on the sofa, on the side he always sits.
        <br>Sanjay slammed the door and walked in.
        <br>I, again as a loner, a single boy looked at the floor where my best friend and my one second crush were kissing, a while back.
        <br>So, every time the bell rang, Sanjay would go. he would give the girls, the card from the right pocket and the left pocket for the boys and what an insult to mankind and what a disgrace. For the girls, he wrote solid cheesy sexy pick-up lines and for the boy he wrote, “Welcome and why did you come?”
        <br>Each time the heroines come to the hero either in real life or in Hollywood or any other wood, I would get really, really jealous. How come they kiss ‘n’ number of times, when I got none.
        <br>Not fair.
        <br>If I were the judge, I would sue all of them. If I was in a military court, I’d court-martial them all.
        <br>I was apparently more single than a singularity defined black hole that sucks in light and time around.
        <br>Some guests have already come. My lame guests also came in the night, thank God. I would have killed them if they came in the morning 10 to disturb my sleep.
        <br>The doorbell rang again.
        <br>“Now who is Sanjay going to kiss.” I said to myself counting the number of girls he made a line to.
        <br>The door opened wide.
        <br>Sanjay smiled at the man in white loose pant and a patterned top that was tucked in. He smoked a cigar like a don but he worked as an accountant in Ralph Lauren.
        <br>“Sanjay is now going to kiss his first gay kiss ever.” I spoke, between the girls.
        <br>“Antonio!” Priyanka shouted as she got up from her seat.
        <br>“Ant onion.” I mumbled.
        <br>Amya stamped my leg with the tip of her heels.
        <br>Sanjay gave the man a card from his left pocket and the man blushed and pushed Sanjay aside with all his dread might, after reading the details.
        <br>Sanjay came few steps back, losing his authority and I finally found his missing father.
        <br>For one second, it was like he and Antonio were in a competition for the number of girls fanbase.
        <br>“Close your eyes buddy.” Sanjay smiled, as he walked towards me, turned me around, his right hand on my shoulder. He tried his best to console me.
        <br>“It’s either me or him for her today.” I declared in my mind and also said it to Sanjay.
        <br>“So, when are you going to wake up from your age ten Papa John’s dreams.” Sanjay replied, “He is taller than you, smarter than you and moreover, that guy knows to flirt in human language. You speak in pig-Latin and the mumbled version of that. He's handsome and great and he also has a girlfriend named Priyanka.” He laughed.
        <br>I punched Sanjay on his belly.
        <br>He went a step back and said, “Okay don't worry. Good things always takes time. She will come to you soon. Just wait for the tree to give the apple. The tree.”
        <br>“Then Newton guy would...” I spoke.
        <br>“Leave the inventor…” He interrupted, “Focus on her.”
        <br>I nodded to him left and right of my head. And without any other word coming out of our mouth, we split apart to enjoy the party.
        <br>I again, again back to loner, single and fulfilling that invisible document I signed. I wished I signed to get a million dollars in one hand and Priyanka on the other hand. Legs would have the most expensive shoe of course.
        <br>All the guests have arrived.
        <br>Now, whose turn was it. Yeah! To my solid recollection, it is Amya's turn for events and games. I hope she does not jump like how she did during farewell.
        <br>So, there were a total of thirteen people were there in the most amazing and boring party. I called good people who didn't come and the worst in list, actually appeared.
        <br>Therefore, using the theory that is stated as hypothetical in the field of science and nanometers, this party is boring.
        <br>Hence by obtuse angle theory, we are all bad.
        <br>We got just less than the number we called to the party, which is cost saving at one hand and other hand, boring. We could save some money to survive for the first few days of the year.
        <br>So, we all thirteen people sat on the sofa and brought in chairs and sat next to the sofa. Amya, stood in front of the sofa, in front of us, blocking the television.
        <br>Amya looked excited, I hated that.
        <br>*Whenever some nerdy or bookish people or friends of yours become excited, then be careful of their ears. They have something planned to kill you by some knowledge that they have stored after years of studying that would burst.*
        <br>Amya jumped high and measured it to be my height and said, “So hello everyone this is Amya.”
        <br>“I know.” I said to myself.
        <br>“I am the event coordinator.” She continued.
        <br>“Who Am I then?” I asked.
        <br>“Don't interrupt bitches when they speak. They will bark.” Pretty sexy lady who came first, and sat next to me, pushed herself to my side and then said in whisper to my ears.
        <br>I shook with a thousand-kilowatt power of electric shocks when her fingertip atoms touched me.
        <br>“I know but just to make the little bitch annoyed.” I said to her back in whisper.
        <br>That girl blushed after hearing my joke and covered her mouth to avoid Amya to understand that we both were actually making fun of her.
        <br>“So, we are going to play a game, so each of you tell us what was the funniest, and best thing you ever did this year. Share it to each of us. We are excited to hear it from you.” Amya continued.
        <br>“Like I am interested in a lame girl nerd question.” I whispered into the ear of the pretty girl next to me.
        <br>She again blushed, covering her mouth.
        <br>How strong that smile drew me off?
        <br>It was a driving force to my sudden flirting behavior that came into existence from nowhere to my mouth.
        <br>“What was your experience that made you excitement over this year?” I asked her, awaiting a reply.
        <br>“Why should I explain what was my most memorable and happiest moment in this year to a stranger?” She asked me.
        <br>“I am Shyam.” I said giving her a handshake, extending my open palm towards the pretty lady.
        <br>She shook hands with me. All of a sudden electric shock struck me from the inside. Gentle breeze came from nowhere to my face and my hair started to fly. Only I could feel all these. No body could see what I was seeing. Well!
        <br>“Rachel. That's my name.” She spoke.
        <br>“Nice name.” I replied.
        <br>“Stop hitting hard, Shyam!” She spoke as she turned her attention to Amya. 
        <br>I smiled looking down. 
        <br>“I don’t complement people for no sake of reason.” I explained in some random words. 
        <br>“Then tell me what’s the reason in your head.” She asked, still looking at Amya’s lame performance.
        <br>“How do you know this bitch.” I asked back at her.
        <br>“This isn’t an answer to my question.” She turned towards me.
        <br>“Everything doesn’t need an answer.” I replied.
        <br>“Then what is your reason?” She again insisted me to talk out the reason from my damn mouth.
        <br>“What do you think?” I whispered back at her.
        <br>She replied, “I think, I am going to give you one tight…”
        <br>“Kiss?” I interrupted her. “I thought of you to be a good pretty lady. And after making this expression in my head, you want me to kiss you.” I acted disappointed. Everyone listened to us.
        <br>She tried to correct herself, “I did not mean…”
        <br>“It’s okay… You can kiss me if you want…” I spoke publicly insulting myself.
        <br>She started to laugh and talk with huge interest, “I don’t want to kiss you right now…”
        <br>“Okay then midnight is fine.” I declared, “Now shut up!” I turned towards Amya, “Continue Match-Fixer.”
        <br>The pretty lady bend herself and lay her side on my side. “Maybe Shyam is going to get an something more than a kiss tonight.” She got a topic to whisper.
        <br>“What the… By the way, how do you know and handle this bitch.” I asked her pointing at Amya, who started to talk.
        <br>“What to do? She joined our office. She invited me out of the blue. I don't even talk to her.” She spoke.
        <br>I smiled and bit my lips.
        <br>“What happened?” she asked after giving a second, seeing my behavior.
        <br>“I was thinking as to how such a beautiful and pretty looking girl could ever have a friendship with such a boring, lame bitch.” I flirted.
        <br>Did I jump into some flirting store in the morning or what?
        <br>I suddenly realized I kind of flirted with her. The first time ever, I got a good response for my flirty dialogue.
        <br>She smiled and looked away.
        <br>“Where do you live?” She asked.
        <br>“This is my apartment. This party was my idea. But the things going on right now are not. Amya and Sanjay changed the entire theme of the party into boring and don't-come-again. I had better plans. I spoke.
        <br>“I would really like to come to the party you made up.” She blushed and uttered.
        <br>“You are first one now... Because nobody would come to my party.” I replied.
        <br>“I will come.” She replied.
        <br>“Then it would be you and me.” I whispered, adjusting my ass towards her.
        <br>“Yeah!” She said looking straight into my eyes and gave one small glance on to my lips. I copied her and looked at her lips. But for a change looked at it for a while.
        <br>“What happened?” she asked.
        <br>“How lonely are your lips? I wish if you let me give your lips a warm gesture.” I pushed out accidentally a pick-up line from my mouth. But she like it.
        <br>She blushed.
        <br>I continued to look at her lips with a tinge more passion than before, even though, before was some random thoughts of looking but now was the desperate version of me, who wanted more in life.
        <br>She pushed my face towards Amya and ordered me, “Not to think rubbish before the start of the next year, Shyam... You will go out to be spoilt little man.”
        <br>“But I can do the same at the end of the year…” I suggested.
        <br>“Calm down before I kiss you.” She shut me up.
        <br>I shut up myself.
        <br>Mind was thinking a thousand things. My mind said to myself that this girl turned me to say pick up lines. She might be the one who would be with me, my entire life. Like a soulmate.
        <br>She came close to my ears and whispered again, “I know what you are thinking. Stop thinking about me in your head. You dumb moron.”
        <br>Again, electricity entered my ears. My heart said she is the one. My mind decided to try to kiss but then at the right moment, the right moment, a bitch came running right to the middle of us.
        <br>“Well, Rachel! Hello.” Amya said waving her hand towards her, “Now we have to go up next from you. Come tell us you're experience this year to all of us.”
        <br>Rachel got up and stood next to Amya and Amya came and sat next to me. Amya hit my thigh hard and told me to stop up.
        <br>“Come on lady. Don't be shy. Tell us.” Amya shouted loudly and 90% percent of that words went into my ears. Maybe more. I covered my ear in pain and pushed her.
        <br>Rachel started to speak with a bit of hesitation in her voice, “So this year was fun. I met new people.”
        <br>“Like me!” I said to myself.
        <br>“Also, I am a dumb person to sleep with my step brother.” She uttered clapping her face.
        <br>“That's less weird.” I spoke to nobody.
        <br>She stared at me for a second and then she continued, forgetting about me, “I started doing part-time jobs in the night. I work as a striper.”
        <br>“I kissed a striper! Cool!” exclaimed Sanjay praising his lips with his hand.
        <br>“Dumb Fuck... She is a striper… She is a part-time bitch.” I said to myself, “Who turned me on.” my eyes widened. “Oh! Turner!”
        <br>Rachel continued, “So I would like to tell you what happened between one customer and me during a night. I mean it is quirky but it was something that made my night. He tried a very special make that made me feel like…” Looking at the ceiling and shouted, “Humm! Ah!”
        <br>That’s the words out of my saint Latin dictionary. She thought outside my box.
        <br>“Thank you, Rachel. Now go back to your seat.” Amya said interrupting her.
        <br>Amya pushed Rachel from her back and I pulled Sanjay to my side to fill the gap and everybody did the same. Then at last, Rachel girl was made to sit on a chair on the end of the line; let’s go striper! I mean, let the stripper get out.
        <br>Amya now asked Sanjay to come and tell his experience. Sanjay got up and Amya took his seat and also 90% killing authority of my ears.
        <br>“So, the best thing I have to ever talk about and tell everyone is about my friend, Shyam.” Sanjay said.
        <br>I got delighted.
        <br>“What about me?” I asked.
        <br>“Does anybody know who my friend's crush is?” Sanjay shouted.
        <br>“Nobody would be interested in that topic of my life.” I interrupted him all at once. Everyone eyed on me and I became like an innocent 10-year-old.
        <br>“Priyanka!” Sanjay shouted.
        <br>My mind melted down hearing her name and also, I almost packed the inside of me for my journey to hell.
        <br>“Yeah… Even I want to know… Tell who is this untold mysterious Shyam's crush?” Priyanka asked.
        <br>She acted too dumb.
        <br>I thought I just needed to run away anything soon and got prepared. Priyanka didn't get it even after Sanjay called her.
        <br>“It’s you! Pretty Priyanka” Sanjay said spelling Priyanka slowly like how the teachers teach children in preschool.
        <br>“She knows her spelling… You don’t have to teach her, Sanjay.” I shouted out sarcastically.
        <br>She looked at me.
        <br>My heart sook. I felt small compared to her. Everyone looked at me. I felt like I did a murder and like Sanjay declared it to everyone that I committed a murder.
        <br>I looked down. I felt ashamed and embarrassed.
        <br>“That's right Priyanka. Shyam like you.” Sanjay again confirmed.
        <br>“From when was this?” Priyanka asked me.
        <br>“Since the start of high school. You were new and popular. He was a kind person who got his heart broken. Yeah! He did not dare to talk to you because he feared that you would go away, further away from him.” Sanjay explained.
        <br>I did not know why on earth Sanjay was saying this all in the end of the year. But I could see a change in the facial expression of Priyanka. I think she could change and like me back, say to Antonio, “I don’t like you… I love *Shyam*!” and kiss me on midnight.
        <br>“Whenever you walk into school, he would stand in the corner and look at you. Whenever you hugged a boy in high school, he would cry. Whenever you were with the wrong guys, he was the person who helped you from behind.” Sanjay continued to explain a lot about me.
        <br>I did not say all these things to him. How did he get to know about these things? Who told him that? A very interesting and complicated question that is in concern now, idiot.
        <br>“Uh Oh!” I spoke.
        <br>“Yeah. You remember Brick. He took a dare from his friends, to date you, kiss you and then dump you when you start liking him back. And Shyam got shocked when he got to know about this. He created a scene. He fought with Brick indirectly and gave him a suspension. You cried but he was happy knowing that it did you good indirectly.”
        <br>“Oh! Shut up. You hit Brick because of this.” Amya slapped my face and then hugged me saying, “You're great. I did not know that you hit Brick for this reason.” into my ears in whisper.
        <br>The first time she ever whispered to my support and what she said made me feel relieved.
        <br>I patted her and gently pushed Amya away.
        <br>“He is the only person in the world who thinks good for you even though you hurt him a trillion times. He deserves more. He is still the same person since high school. You changed, I changed, Amya changed not in height or weight but in age and mind but now also, he thinks about your happiness. He knows that one day you will understand him and like him back.” Sanjay continued.
        <br>Everyone was in a realization phase.
        <br>“Oh, Come on… He is still single and a virgin for you.” Sanjay again continued.
        <br>Thanks for saying my relationship and virginity status to all the people who have gathered here, Sanjay.
        <br>“Do you think there is anybody else better than Shyam? Your father kicks you out of the house but Shyam always and forever lets you in…” Sanjay asked.
        <br>My mouth opened.
        <br>My ears ready to hear what she replied. This is a real and real kind of a question. I want to know if I am in her mind or even if I was her mind. I bit my nails and began to appear nervous.
        <br>I never became this level of nervous before. This few seconds was a time that told me what I am for.
        <br>Priyanka looked down. I saw a drop of tear hanging from the lower tip of her eye. That hurt me.
        <br>I wanted to wipe that off but just waited for her reply.
        <br>“I - I - I don't know.” She replied.
        <br>Everybody's expectations broke. Everybody looked sad. They thought she would accept me and we both would be together happily. But Antonio did not have that thought in his head. He seemed the least confused. His face spoke, “You do what you want, she’s mine.”
        <br>The party continued.
        <br>We had some food that Priyanka ordered. It was good food. I liked the food like how I liked her. Sanjay was next to me. I understood that he did me the best.
        <br>“Thanks for saying this to her buddy. I didn't know how to say this to her.” I thanked him hugging him tight.
        <br>“Friends don't say thanks, buddy.” He said smiling.
        <br>“I know.” I replied.
        <br>“Should I say about the club feeling of yours also?” Sanjay realized another example to say to justify my love.
        <br>“This itself is more than enough. No need of that.” I replied. “And about the virgin thing?”
        <br>“Is that not true?” He hit me, “Who is that unlucky girl?”
        <br>“Not that… I did not lose but you shouldn’t have said that…” I suggested his corrections that couldn’t be made.
        <br>Amya and Priyanka were in the other corner of the room talking something. Amya looked at me, multiple times with a satisfactory smile. I know she was talking about me to her.
        <br>Priyanka looked broken by the fact that I suspended Brick from school. I was the only perfect boyfriend material for her with no guts in my ass. She replied to Amya in a way that made Amya look too much sad.
        <br>I understood by this itself, what she thought about me and what she said about me to Amya.
        <br>It was 11:45 PM.
        <br>I turned on the television. We all stood in pairs. She stood with Antonio. I was the only person sitting alone.
        <br>All of them became ready to wish each other a new year and kiss their partner. I was alone. She did not even look at me.
        <br>I drank the apple juice like alcohol and regrets grew around me as I banged my fist on the edge of the table, recollecting all the amazing moments, I spend with her.
        <br>“You should be with her.” A voice came into my ears.
        <br>I looked up to see Antonio there. He smiled at me, messed my already messed up wavy hair and left the apartment. I turned in magnetic silence as he left.
        <br>Peacefully.
        <br>The time was 11:52 PM.
        <br>She sat on a chair in the dining area. She looked at me, pissed off.
        <br>I turned around and looked at her. I was silent. I did not know what to do. I never wrote about such kind of a situation.
        <br>The time became, 11:55 PM.
        <br>I felt calm and regretful behind my soul and peacefulness.
        <br>I felt bad. I wanted to say. I am sorry. I am the worst one side love guy ever. I wanted to say, but couldn’t muster up my courage.
        <br>She probably had a thousand thoughts about me in her mind.
        <br>11:58 PM.
        <br>Everybody got ready in pairs. We both still sat in our seats.
        <br>The television had a countdown from 120 seconds. What’s with the 120 seconds count, brotha? My heart began beating faster than that.
        <br>There was a still eye contact. I doubt anybody wasn't looking at us. Eyes were on us.
        <br>There was no popular girl, no one side lovers, there was no Brick and no Antonio. It was just me and her. Like how I wanted it to be. Just wanted to lose the distance between us.
        <br>11:59:20 PM.
        <br>Everybody started to count the last few moments of the year.
        <br>I too.
        <br>I got up from my seat, quickly. I was still looking at her. Without words to say.
        <br>11:59:31 PM.
        <br>The lights I set went on and the other lights went off. The television getting ready for a new year and also, I was.
        <br>But wanted her. My hands were moving in nervousness.
        <br>11:59:45 PM.
        <br>I shouted in myself to make her in my life for that is what I wanted to happen for ages past.
        <br>11:59:55 PM
        <br>I commanded my legs in a do or die situation to walk towards her. She became aware. Everyone's eyes were on both of us as I marched in quick steps until I reached her.
        <br>**12:00:00 NEW YEAR!**
        <br>I kissed her.
        <br>I wrapped my hand around her waist tight and she held my face with her hands.
        <br>Our lips sweet and eyes closed enjoying the kiss that should have come about a thousand months before and in the past itself.
        <br>I felt like an absolute lucky idiot.
        <br>Our heartbeats sunk. I could feel it.
        <br>I felt like the happiest person on earth. I loved it.
        <br>I had a girl who I loved, in my arms. I won't let her away from me.
        <br>I did the kiss.
        <br>“I love you.” We both said in a sync, “Happy New Year.”
        <br>We both smiled, and my lips shook in uncontrollable blush. Her hands were on my shoulder locked behind my neck. My hands were on her waist locked behind her lower back.
        <br>I loved it.
        <br>Everybody around us smiled and blushed at the sight of my first love story that started to unfold but contradicting everything, they forgot to do what they planned. No body except us kissed that night. No body except us wished their partner, happy new year.
        <br>“I was dumb. I did not know what to do in high school...” I said but she instead of listening to me, interrupted me with a kiss and everyone watched us go, just as they forget about everything.
        <br>And this is the new year.
