      <p>
        I was making up the lighting in our apartment.<br>
        The girls hanging out at our place to do a bit of a decoration so that the invitees don’t walk out calling it a New Year’s Office Meeting.<br>
        Amya, Sanjay, Priyanka, and the valuable writer in the room, had one job to invite an handful of kind people to finish the turkey stuffing and not make our huge apartment lonely at the end of the year.<br>
        But it struck my mind, if we four had friends outside our circle.<br>
        What if outsiders come by as “friends”?<br>
        So, I opened my friend's list and gave a deep breath out as I started to call all the good people who don't vomit in parties and who doesn't cry or simp like a bear in need for his or her mommy and who doesn’t insult me with my office Call names in the party.<br>
        The other two guys and my girl also called some of theirs.<br>
        Now it was the arrangements.<br>
        We called all of them and asked them (clears throat) ordered them to assemble at our apartment at sharp ten in the night.<br>
        One lame friend of mine from work, who writes poems for the newsletter, asked me if he should come in the day ten or night ten.<br>
        And then he smiled for two straight minutes believing that he makes the jokes laughable with that laughter?<br>
        How could a person be so lame at cracking jokes and also be a poet on romance and emotions who sells like a person who never saw an unsold extra copy coming on his table?<br>
        Maybe I should write like him?<br>
        Or act like him?<br>
        Or maybe I should stop thinking about him?<br>
        And I’m out of people to call.<br>
        I was sticking the lights on the wall.<br>
        Sanjay was writing thank-you-for-coming cards.<br>
        Amya was planning the events to be done.<br>
        Priyanka ordered the dinner, snacks and sweets to eat during the party, and constantly kept reassuring that she won’t drink the next year.<br>
        Even though I constantly explained the night she made me debut drunk and accelerated her Dad’s hatchback into the police station.<br>
        The lights were set and it was decided to turn of the general lights off and turn on the temporary lights.<br>
        Sanjay would give the cards whenever an attendee or if some kind of random intruder came in to attend the party, as he grew cold in the cold weather outside.<br>
        Amya would entertain all of us with the events, and games to be done for, after the untamed guests have arrived.<br>
        And as the second last thing of this year, Priyanka would give the guests and me, dinner and sweets to eat.<br>
        At last we all would do a great countdown from whatsoever number to zero and say happy new year, jumping like a 10-year-old knowing that we are going another year older; apparently with a lot of joy.<br>
        And why do we even jump about when we slogged the entire year doing crappy jobs and the earth took the effort to make a revolution, and still didn’t kick us off gravity?<br>
        But for a change, I decided that we all kiss off someone at zero-zero-zero-zero.<br>
        How interesting it would be until, Sanjay kisses Priyanka and I kiss Amya or Amya kisses Priyanka and I, ended my year kissing off Sanjay instead of who I wanted to kiss.<br>
        The other three nodded a perfect and sweet, “Okay”.<br>
        That wouldn’t be the case, if they got around my thoughts on who kisses whom.<br>
        Priyanka remembered and spoke that she would love to kiss that cute guy from her work, Antonio.<br>
        Then, like how pigeons forget its own nest, Amya started to simp for Antonio who she won't be able to kiss.<br>
        What kiss?<br>
        Amya did not see Antonio for even once.<br>
        “Don't know if Antonio would get kissed but I am sure he would get slapped at the end of zero.” I mumbled in whisper.<br>
        Priyanka heard it and shouted, “What?” waving her hands apart.<br>
        “I am few centimeters away from you. Needn't have to shout like a goose.” I said whispering, “My ears.” I said so, walking away punching my index into my ears to reduce the pain on it.<br>
        “I would like to give a smelly hand of help to your good ears.” Sanjay exclaimed, pointing at me as he walking behind me as the girls got into deep whisper.<br>
        “What was that all about?” Sanjay asked, hitting my belly fat.<br>
        “I don't know... They both always simp on Antonio, who is first Italian, Christian, and a dumb flirtation kind of a kid.” I spoke.<br>
        “Hello. I am also a flirtation ship kind of a chick….” Sanjay reminded.<br>
        “Be kindly monkey. You’re in second of my list.” I declared.<br>
        The bell rang.<br>
        All eyes went towards the door.<br>
        Leaving the very source of our own existence, and chasing heart beats out of us as we wanted the anticipation to know who’s on the other side, to be on our face.<br>
        Cut to the chase.<br>
        We all ran towards the door.<br>
        For four different latitude and longitudes of our door, glued the four of us.<br>
        Who cares about the degree?<br>
        We need to open the door first, and invite them.<br>
        “I caught the door handle first… So… According to newton’s third law, I shall open the door.” Sanjay shouted pushing the rest of us away from him and the door.<br>
        He cleared his throat, pulled open the door wide open.<br>
        A beautiful lady with a slight lipstick on her lips, from Amya's office came.<br>
        I did not know that people like Amya would know people like the lady at our door, who look so damn.<br>
        “Don't look at her like that.” Amya whispered into my ears (heavenly god came to peace hearing her whisper).<br>
        I was on the side of the table.<br>
        With my body is a melting state, wiggling my body as if I am boneless and melting at the sight of the lady.<br>
        My eyes were with a lot of hope that I would kiss her.<br>
        Hey! Woah! I am going to kiss this new chick, kill Antonio and marry Priyanka.<br>
        So good, are you?<br>
        Sanjay pulled out one card from his right pocket and handed it to the beautiful lady.<br>
        The lady makes a gesture and accepts the card and she read what Sanjay wrote in it.<br>
        She smiled at him and winked at him in micro-macro seconds.<br>
        She walked into our apartment pushing Sanjay with her palm with a look that meant and allowed Sanjay to come 5x closer than before.<br>
        I quickly came back to my bone state, went towards her and rudely snatched the card from her hand.<br>
        This was because, I am a shy person.<br>
        With a shy smile whenever I talk to a girl who looks really good.<br>
        So just to avoid any kind of scene I just acted rudely.<br>
        I read the words in the card.<br>
        Amya and Priyanka stood by my two sides, leaning themselves on my either shoulder, to read what I was also reading with ultimate interest.<br>
        “Hmm...” Priyanka said.<br>
        “Classic...” Amya said.<br>
        “Teach me some of these cool lines.” I shouted and turned towards Sanjay.<br>
        Sanjay was kissing that girl right on her lips.<br>
        The girl kept her hands over his shoulder, ran it around his top back and enjoyed the kiss, so passionately that the passion fruit company owner went to his grave, dig himself up to die.<br>
        I’m the passion fruit company owner by the way.<br>
        “Cover your eyes.” Amya whispered as she slowly brought her hand to my cover, she did not like me to stare at her colleague like that and face it, she was kissing.<br>
        I pushed her away in frustration.<br>
        I moved towards the sudden kisser.<br>
        I said to Sanjay as he still had his lips on hers, “It is not midnight yet for love of Shyam.”<br>
        He pushed me away in a jerk and continued kissing.<br>
        He ran his right hand to her back lower waist and rested his left hand on her middle back, and turned his nose here and there, and what a disgusting scene it turned out.<br>
        I went back and stood in middle of Amya and Priyanka, who were seeing the kiss very seriously, like a soccer match’s final minute, when the game becomes so serious and exciting.<br>
        Little did I know that they were actually interested in all of these types of contents.<br>
        “I am feelings things...” I spoke.<br>
        Amya and Priyanka stared at me, giving me a dirty look.<br>
        “Hey, why you dirty-looking me?” I got furious and pointed at Sanjay, “He got his tongue in her intestine… Slap him…”<br>
        I looked at each other and smiled.<br>
        They left me alone and went to do their usual makeup.<br>
        I, a loner, a single boy looked at the kissers.<br>
        They stopped kissing.<br>
        The girl hassled back and said, “You’re the kisser! See you after 12… Would the kisser be free any time then?” and she walked inside towards the girls and started mumbling with them.<br>
        “Nah! I got a date with you, to pick up…” Sanjay responded smoothing his hands off her back.<br>
        Sanjay came towards me walking slowly with his legs flying apart as he kept each leg forward.<br>
        “What kind of a glue did you stick on your lips?” I asked him sarcastically.<br>
        And the reply he gave me a reply.<br>
        “A glue that sticks between two lovers.” He spoke.<br>
        “You met her just now…” I hit him back on his belly.<br>
        “Yeah, but it was sudden and amazing with a lot of sync in us.<br>
        Even if I don't know her, even if I don't want to see her again.<br>
        That kiss would glue her to me always.” He used his mouth at me.<br>
        I flicked my fingers on his forehead and turned my eyeballs to the lady who sat on the sofa, on the side he always sits.<br>
        Sanjay slammed the door and walked in.<br>
        I, again as a loner, a single boy looked at the floor where my best friend and my one second crush were kissing, a while back.<br>
        So, every time the bell rang, Sanjay would go.<br>
        he would give the girls, the card from the right pocket and the left pocket for the boys and what an insult to mankind and what a disgrace.<br>
        For the girls, he wrote solid cheesy sexy pick-up lines and for the boy he wrote, “Welcome and why did you come?”<br>
        Each time the heroines come to the hero either in real life or in Hollywood or any other wood, I would get really, really jealous.<br>
        How come they kiss ‘n’ number of times, when I got none.<br>
        Not fair.<br>
        If I were the judge, I would sue all of them.<br>
        If I was in a military court, I’d court-martial them all.<br>
        I was apparently more single than a singularity defined black hole that sucks in light and time around.<br>
        Some guests have already come.<br>
        My lame guests also came in the night, thank God.<br>
        I would have killed them if they came in the morning 10 to disturb my sleep.<br>
        The doorbell rang again.<br>
        “Now who is Sanjay going to kiss.” I said to myself counting the number of girls he made a line to.<br>
        The door opened wide.<br>
        Sanjay smiled at the man in white loose pant and a patterned top that was tucked in.<br>
        He smoked a cigar like a don but he worked as an accountant in Ralph Lauren.<br>
        “Sanjay is now going to kiss his first gay kiss ever.” I spoke, between the girls.<br>
        “Antonio!” Priyanka shouted as she got up from her seat.<br>
        “Ant onion.” I mumbled.<br>
        Amya stamped my leg with the tip of her heels.<br>
        Sanjay gave the man a card from his left pocket and the man blushed and pushed Sanjay aside with all his dread might, after reading the details.<br>
        Sanjay came few steps back, losing his authority and I finally found his missing father.<br>
        For one second, it was like he and Antonio were in a competition for the number of girls fanbase.<br>
        “Close your eyes buddy.” Sanjay smiled, as he walked towards me, turned me around, his right hand on my shoulder.<br>
        “Excuse me?” I asked furiously.<br>
        “Turn around, you’re going to get your first real kiss.” Sanjay whispered into my ear.<br>
        “Don’t make me punch you.” I said with anger on my face.<br>
        He laughed and walked away.<br>
        Antonio walked towards the girls.<br>
        Amya’s cheeks flushed.<br>
        Priyanka blushed and ran towards Antonio.<br>
        He grabbed her hand and kissed her cheeks.<br>
        Priyanka jumped, squealed and hugged him.<br>
        “Well, Antonio is here and my year is complete.” She said, holding his hands.<br>
        “Huh, then what about the countdown kiss?” Amya asked.<br>
        “You, my dear will get yours too.” Antonio winked.<br>
        And all the girls giggled and ran off together.<br>
        Leaving me again, the loner.<br>
        I sighed, leaned back on the wall and said, “Well, Happy damn New Year to me.”<br>
