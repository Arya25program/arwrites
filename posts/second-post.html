      <p>
        Back in those days, school teachers weren’t allowed a grant to take personal tuition for some select students, but that somehow existed.<br>
        We were in grade 12, a bunch of five boys and three girls of different masses and thoughts and we were also accompanied by a few from the lower grades as well.<br>
        The teacher was a wholesome jam-packed with lots of wisdom and if there were groups of people who were called old-metric-mindset, easily said our teacher was not even close to the list. She had white hair over her long strands but she was really understanding and to be honest, my girlfriend has not given me a tiny inch of understanding that this teacher showered upon us. <br>
        We were lucky enough to get a teacher who did as much to score our asses back to studying after a year of slogging relaxation.<br>
        Today was like no different at all.<br>
        There were the same books, the old dead-people-theory chapters had all our minds sunk in.<br>
        In the middle did we turn our heads in sudden questions and answer sessions or when our autistic writer says something autistic.<br>
        He was the symbol of true stupidity even though some of his works are really great. When he says something, his thoughts I don't know, but he says a long line and by the time the joke is understood, we lose our attention span after all.<br>
        He self-published a book online and from that day on, one could hear posts of himself talking like a 40 year old Chetan Bagat. He may have gotten the feeling but was no longer closer.<br>
        It was at 5.30 when that message arrived. One of our fellow friends turned up late but had news of great distress to our teacher.<br>
        The other teachers in school wanted to make a surprise visit to prove that our teacher has been taking tuition off the records.<br>
        In the deepest thoughts of one 11th grader as I decoded, she felt relieved because she didn't want to turn up daily for classes and was rather interested in falling asleep than working for something that was more realistic.<br>
        The teacher told all of us to leave but sounding bad to my gut that we all would be caught anyway. Even if we left, we would meet the bunch of teachers down there or we may meet them over here.<br>
        Meeting was a damn purity to ‘yes’ and couldn't be denied.<br>
        Just as our teacher told us all to leave. Our autistic kid stood up, in long conversations.<br>
        “If we all leave, they will catch us,” he said. “None of us are leaving,”<br>
        “Then it would be easier for them to prove that ma'am takes tuition.” said the 11th girl who couldn't get away from the thought of staying back for today.<br>
        “We don't phrase it like that.” he moved to the centre of the room and behaving like a mad scientist spoke, “I, Aravind, Kevin came here to visit Neeraj for group studies and while taking a break we came over here.”<br>
        “Why did you come over here?” I asked him, doubtlessly.<br>
        “Ma'am's husband's birthday, let it be today. You all are invited. Neeraj, your parents are at home, call them here, whosoever stays in this vast colony, get your parents here. Alright?” he became more clear.<br>
        “My husband's birthday is not less than two months.” the teacher would say and we would go to a standstill.<br>
        “You shifted here, we got time.” he replied, behaving back to his actual known identifiable form; autism.<br>
        “What?” another girl who hated him, dawned with a word.<br>
        “Ma'am moved here from two blocks apart last week. So, if they arrive, they would naturally turn up there.” he turns around and says to everyone, “So, plus the searching of the building number and all, in turn buys us time.”<br>
        “Netra, Priya, Neeraj, Aravind, Josh, join up in a conference and will say what all to be done,” he said.<br>
        A call was set up in the instant. Kids who stayed in the same colony invited their parents ASAP, and the teacher seemed confused at all.<br>
        Suddenly it dawned that these people openly believed the idea of our autistic kid, in a blindfolded format.<br>
        Neeraj, pulled by our autistic kiddo, headed to the door.<br>
        In the call, he said, “We both are gonna buy some goodies for the party and you will try to clean up the room, push the beds together, hide all books of the room, push your bags and books into ma'am's study cupboards and cover up with her books. Except mine, Aravind and Kevin's bags.”<br>
        Neeraj and the autistic kid went down the lift and sprinted to the nearby supermarket outside the boundaries of the colony, with a little cash in his pocket as always.<br>
        In the meanwhile, Josh, another mate went downstairs and kept a close watch at what the teacher's were up to in distant range with a binoculars he took with him from ma'am's apartment.<br>
        When they both were at the store, a video editor was going through rigorous tasks. Our 11th sleepy grader, also a video editor for some random movie shots for Instagram reach, forced upon editing uncle's passport to today's day of birth.<br>
        “When they ask for a passport for proof, ma'am has to tell them that the company he worked in, took the employee's passports, until they needed it for a valid reason. Naturally, the buggers will ask for an online copy and Netra, you know what to do…” he became silent all of a sudden.<br>
        Netra pulled out ma'am's laptop and started to edit a softcopy of uncle's passport. The house was on fire, as the boys and a few others from lower grades, visualised what a party house is like, started to remake the appeal of a party of a 50 year old.<br>
        Peacefully unnoticed, uncle was woken up from bed. He felt he jumped in time, after he took an afternoon nap. He woke up all drowsy seeing everyone run about more than he has in his apartment.<br>
        Our teacher took him aside, and explained everything and we got a new member onboard, uncle joined the call.<br>
        “The worst thing to happen is ma'am getting caught. If there were things trying to stop that, it wouldn't be that worse, sir.” the autistic kid said to uncle. For which the drowsy uncle agreed.<br>
        “The teachers will call you now, ma'am.” the kid said, “When they do, give the call to Bhaiya in google meet and make him talk utter nonsense. Make it clear that it is your son first and then when they ask for the location of their stay, tell them the way from the opposite entrance of their entry.” he sounded smart.<br>
        Ma'am's elder son, in Ontario, was called in for a morning google meeting. He joined and was absolutely excited even if he just woke up.<br>
        The call came in at impeccable timing. Bhaiya picked up the call over the google meet, uttering slow and clear words in a very deep tone, “Hello?”<br>
        “Is Ma'am there?” One teacher would ask.<br>
        “Amma is in the restroom.” Bhaiya answered in a deep voice, saying to his microphone in Ontario, and ma’am held her phone near the speaker of her laptop.<br>
        “Where is your stay?” the teacher asked and the kids nearby held their mouths steady as Bhaiya behaved like a drunk.<br>
        “Go straight from there.” he said.<br>
        “How do you know where I am?” the teacher asked a valid question.<br>
        “Hey, I live in Ontario.” he declared, “If there were google maps, the second is me… follow me.” he said, guiding them through the correct direction but if they came from the opposite side, alone.<br>
        The colony was huge, adding to the plus points of wasting time.<br>
        From the living room balcony, Priya saw us boys coming.<br>
        “Bhaiya enough..” texted our autistic kid and ma'am ended the call with the teacher. Bhaiya in Ontario, stood away from the laptop to have a bite.<br>
        “You will bring the cake along with them. I will meet you at the top. Don't say I was with you, okay? And don’t breathe heavily… Keep calm…” the autistic kid said, running away.<br>
        Neeraj, with the cake and a plastic knife, walked to the other entrance of the building and met with the four teachers.<br>
        “What are you doing Neeraj?” a teacher who thinks she has eagle-like eyes, spotted Neeraj, walking towards them.<br>
        “What are you doing here?” Neeraj asked back.<br>
        “We came to meet your class teacher.” the headmaster said.<br>
        “She lives here.” Neeraj said, pointing to the nearby building.<br>
        From there they started to walk forward, into the building.<br>
        Priya and Netra were sent to the top floor to hold the lift open for a long time. Now the teachers who haven't used staircases for decades working at school will have to climb four floors.<br>
        But before that thought comes, the lift will be released and Priyas's mother comes down and out from the lift. She gave a smile to everyone and walked out of the building.<br>
        But Netra and Priya went upstairs to the lift management system and with the autistic kid's comment, spranced their girly touch on some wires when the lift just reached the fourth floor.<br>
        The autistic kid walked into the apartment, made sure everything was in place, stuck the long birthday poster on the wall, and looked at everything in such an orderly manner, smiled at all the parents who arrived.<br>
        “He looks way more autistic now, doesn't he.” comments Aravind.<br>
        The party was set and uncle played some party music on the TV as everyone was forced to be in a party vibe forgetting the final exam coming in two months and a teacher raid any moment.<br>
        Everyone did some big tasks and the party was on, baby.<br>
        I mean it was party time.<br>
        “Considering the worst time to party is now, we party now, alright?” the autistic kid spoke.<br>
        Few moments later, he pulled Aravind and went towards the stairs and behaved as if he is called Neeraj out of the odd terms, waiting for the cake.<br>
        Just then, the voices of the autistic kid and Aravind echoed into the lift and Neeraj along with the teachers made sounds; they could be good screams or bad screams but there was a definite increase in screams.<br>
        Everything appeared so faked up.<br>
        “Let the plugs go in T-10.” the autistic kid said as he slapped into the damn military standards of communication.<br>
        “T-10?” Priya responded back from above.<br>
        “Timer of 10 seconds…” Aravind responds as he aids the kid to open the lift's doors wide like some superhero film.<br>
        “I told you to bring a cake and you brought school teachers…” The autistic kid scolded Neeraj as he handed over the cake box, passing it to Aravind.<br>
        “I found them on the way.” Neeraj replied, stretching out his arms.<br>
        “You will find Hitler when you come back again, bring him instead.” he would reply as if this was his own fake birthday party.<br>
        The lift was just half a metre down and someone had to pull to get them out. Neeraj was pulled out by Aravind and the kid, while the teachers waited.<br>
        As soon as Neeraj came out off the lift, the girls turned the lift back smoothly as the timer went zero and the lift came up with lights.<br>
        “You were the problem?” Aravind joked as the teachers walked in, and into the party.<br>
        “I called ma'am's phone… Her son picked up and spoke and told us the wrong directions.” said a teacher, wiping off her sweat on her forehead.<br>
        But the person who set everything up, didn't sweat at all.<br>
        “What? he's in Ontario…” he spoke and the teacher got into deep thought as to whom she spent moments back talking with.<br>
        Let it be unanswered.<br>
        Soon the lift controller users came into the party and it was unexpectedly a decent party in such a 25 minute shaking.<br>
        They had their share of the cake and party the autistic kid spent on the cake. They did a lot of cakewalk in the middle and nodded off and left dejected as they did not have any clues of her taking personal tuitions.<br>
        Everyone stayed nearby and parents made job connections with uncle and for us kids, it was easy to say group studies.<br>
        They left, but our autistic kid wasn't done yet.<br>
        He pulled out a few stones from the pots in the living room, sneaked out of the door when nobody saw and tossed it hard into the shoes of a few teacher's.<br>
        So when they left he could say, “You still want the lift ride, huh sir?” and they would be confused, “This time there's no cake inside for me to come and call and heroically open the lift for.”<br>
        And they turned away to the stairs and he counted on the sounds of the stones on the floor, until they counted up to complete the ground floor.<br>
        The way he counted, made everyone angry for some reason.<br>
        After he confirmed the sound's streak was complete, he walked in, played a random song, cut off a slice and munched on it.<br>
        And when everyone stared at his back, I would turn away and say, “What? I am autistic and I am a deceiver and a manipulator and a writer. What more do you want from me? Go back to study, kids.” he would say.<br>
        And when everyone went back to studying and Priya got a doubt, Neeraj said an answer and the 12th graders split up into two arguing for which was correct while our autistic kid lifted his hand, silencing everyone to say, “You got 12, you got 13… But first tell me which formula to use…”<br>
        Why? I am that autistic kid.
