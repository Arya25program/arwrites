      <p>Summer of 25.<br>
      “Would you still want something that never wanted you?” I asked myself, staring into the mirror.<br>
      For wanting something is irrespective of getting it or not. It’s not about owning what you want. Life is simple when you know and feel the urge to want something sweet.<br>
      Every end, they say has a new beginning, but what if the end of something isn’t what we need. What if the beginning comes with the cost of the ending we never wanted?<br>
      I’ll still hold onto everything even if I’ll destroy myself with the thoughts of losing what I never wanted to lose.<br>
      Something who called me their forever person shouldn’t call me their forever never person just cause time and season changes or their mindset changes.<br>
      Misery of this time, no?<br>
      We tend to want things we can never own but obsess on, to fill voids we can’t fill ourselves within us and to be in deed of what hates us.<br>

      It was just hours after the biology paper ended. The humid weather and my heated body weren’t a good match to what was coming ahead and the sweaty meat as I am, didn’t like the scent of it as well.<br>
      I still remember that moment, when I last saw her.<br>
      Her, whom I showered with love, care, support, affection and, stood by through her difficulties, and who also stood by with me.<br>
      That was the last day I saw her.<br>
      Through the metro journey, she kept reassuring it was just a few weeks of being away. And that with the passing of time, we would meet again and spent more time together. She reassured everything was going to be okay and I had to be excited going home, instead of worrying.<br>
      To her, it seemed like a few weeks.<br>
      To me, it seemed like a wait either everything or just nothing. I never believed that people feel if you stay away from them. It’s like after a while, you get used to the feeling of being away.<br>
      “You go back…” She responded, “You have to pack also… It will become late for you to the airport.”<br>
      “I came this far… Dropping you to the auto, won’t be a time taker.” I responded, hanging onto all the time I could spent with her.<br>
      We walked down the stairs leading out of the metro station.<br>
      “Shall I give you a tight hug?” I asked her.<br>
      Before she could reply, I moved in from her back, wrapped my left arm around her lower neck, and my right around her waist front, and forehead over the back of her shoulder, feeling the comfort with mid-teary eyes, and squeezed into her like a baby doll.<br>
      “People are watching…” She responded moments in after I stuck to her, “It’s near my home also and people know me here…”<br>
      I gave her a breathing space.<br>
      An auto driver got booked on the app in her phone and she looked at me, with sudden wavering eyes of urgency and confusion.<br>
      Would you calm down and just look at me?<br>
      “Are you leaving?” I asked her, feeling stolen inside.<br>
      “I’ll see you soon.” She hugged me again.<br>
      Wrapping my arms around her waist, and pushing a moist imprint of my lips on her neck, she whispered, “Take care… I love you…”<br>
      Running to the auto.<br>
      You didn’t let me say my final love you.<br>
      You didn’t wait.<br>
      You left, after we hung out.<br>
      ***<br>
      That was the last time, I felt the speciality of loving someone.<br>
      The holiday season after the End Semester exams pulled us into countries apart, for over fifty days.<br>
      I came back hostel, dropping her home, and the time dilated slower. It was twenty minutes from the mall, and it took me more than a forty back to the same mall.<br>
      I could already tell that I miss her.<br>
      I pulled in my EarPods, sitting in the corner seat in somewhat middle compartment, right under the charging port, I felt the urge for her to fill the gap of the seat beside me.<br>
      I wished she’d accompany me like I did, to drop her to home.<br>
      Every holiday I had before, was the easiest to take off with a lot of excitement.<br>
      But this time, I felt weird.<br>
      I had given my best and realest to someone and now moving away is hard for me. I had worries in my head, with the problems running around recently that couldn’t get my mind off.<br>
      Even though moving away with an assurance of meeting soon, was easier than moving away completely, it felt the same for me.<br>
      Why do we stay apart, when we know we need each other?<br>
      I’m not overthinking, but I was truly feeling a lot.<br>
      I remember texting her saying it was lovely the past few months, and I reposted a story of our friend’s group in her account on my phone, I initially posted. Scrolled reels trying to pull myself together, still seeing couple dudes on vertical screens, love making basically.<br>
      I had a tiny hope some friend of her’s would see me in the metro, tearing up and would tell her that. She would get all clingy and cuddly then, and it would be comforting.<br>
