      <p>
        Saturday night and I just pulled off that Norte’s Stocks up by 12 and at moments past midnight, sipped coffee off a cold glass at my balcony. The city lights light up the sky bright and I would swear it didn’t resemble the sight of a midnight sky.<br>
        The doorbell rang.<br>
        It was her — my girl. Her visits were always unexpected, but they never failed to fill me with a sense of relief. The door went wide, and she gave me a cunning tight hug and chucked her purse onto the sofa.<br>
        “I thought you fell asleep.” I asked her. “Isn’t it too late past your bedtime?”<br>
        “Thought I’d surprise you,” she said, turning her side towards me.<br>
        “Ohh, you really did,” I replied, a small laugh escaping my mouth. “I wondered who dared to ring me up in middle of my coffee stall.”<br>
        I handed her my cup of coffee and she took off a sip as we walked towards the balcony to catch a cold breeze of the not-so-looking midnight.<br>
        “Always a better coffee.” she murmured, taking a sip and leaning against the balcony railing.<br>
        “Continue.” I spoke making a gentle nod.<br>
        Her eyes moved across slower than usual and she suddenly caught my sight, taking a sip off, “What about you? How did the stock go?”<br>
        “I just finished,” I said, feeling a surge of pride despite my exhaustion. “It went better than what Debris had his eyes on.”<br>
        She smiled, but something about it seemed quite off. “Good. You’ve always been good at making things work.”<br>
        I sounded “Yeah.”<br>
        “Perhaps in the terms that counterparts your clients.” She interrupted me.<br>
        I chuckled, “Clients don’t know what they really want. Its me and the other agents like me that take them to the right destination of purchase and profits and shares.”<br>
        Mid-conversation, the phone rang.<br>
        The landline.<br>
        I frowned. Who would call this late? “Hold on,” I said, standing up to answer it.<br>
        As I crossed the living room, I picked up the receiver, a twinge of annoyance mixing with my curiosity. “Hello. Benson on this side.”<br>
        A deep, somber voice responded on the other end. “Benson.”<br>
        “Uh, yeah... Who’s this?”<br>
        "I’m Emma’s father,” the man said, his voice cracking under a weight of grief. “She left home an hour ago.” Her father spoke.<br>
        I interrupted him, “Oh, Dad…”<br>
        “She met with an accident.” He interrupted me.<br>
        My blood froze. I felt the world spin beneath me. “W-What?”<br>
        “I’m so sorry. She... She lost a lot of blood… Couldn’t make it.” He added, crying.<br>
        “What are you saying?” I responded, “She’s right here with me.”<br>
        “What?” He exclaimed.<br>
        I took the phone away from my ears, going to hang up as I realized her father’s sound echoed around the silent room, “She's no more. I don’t know who is with you.”<br>
        I stood there, the phone slipping slightly in my grip, and fell back into its place. My heart pounded in my chest, each beat louder than the last. But… she was here. She was just—<br>
        I turned around slowly, and there she was. Standing right behind me. Her eyes locked onto mine, calm and steady, as if she had heard every word of the conversation.<br>
        “Who was it?” she asked softly, tilting her head ever so slightly.<br>
        My throat became dry now. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. I just stared at her with fear in my eyes for who it was is true or was that call a scam, trying to process what I’d heard.<br>
        “Who was on the phone, honey?” she asked again, stepping closer. There was a slight tilt in her smile now, something more sinister behind the familiar curve of her lips.<br>
        “It... it was your dad,” I whispered, my voice shaking. “He said... You were in an accident.”<br>
        Her expression didn’t change. “Did he?” she asked, her voice unnervingly calm.<br>
        My heart raced, the air thick with tension. “What... is happening?” I gasped, feeling the room grow smaller, the walls pressing in.<br>
        She moved closer still, the shadows deepening around her as if the darkness clung to her skin. “What’s wrong, Emma? I’m right here,”<br>
        She whispered, her voice low, and intimate. “You don’t believe him, do you? You see me. You see me breathe. I’m here.”<br>
        I backed away, my pulse thundering in my ears. “You’re not... you’re not supposed to be here.”<br>
        Her smile widened, her eyes gleaming with a cold, unnatural light. “Why not?” she asked, her voice taking on an edge of mockery. “Am I not enough for you?”<br>
        She took another step forward, her face inches from mine now, her breath cold against my skin. “Tell me you believe in something,” she whispered, her voice like ice.<br>
        My back hit the wall. I couldn’t breathe properly. “I... I don’t understand...”<br>
        “You don’t need to understand,” she hissed, her voice sharp now, filled with a strange hunger. “You just need to *believe.*”<br>
        The air between us crackled with tension. My skin prickled, a cold sweat breaking out across my forehead. I felt trapped, cornered. And then her eyes flickered, for just a second, revealing something dark and hollow beneath them.<br>
        “Tell me you love me,” she demanded, her voice growing harsher, more desperate. “Tell me I’m here.”<br>
        I swallowed hard, my heart pounding in my chest. “I... I love you...”<br>
        She smiled again, but it was wrong, all wrong. Her hand reached up, her fingers brushing against my cheek, colder than ice it felt than the breezy cold night.<br>
        And then, in a voice barely more than a whisper, she said, “Good. Because now... I’ll never leave.”<br>
        The lights flickered a little gradually, and suddenly the room was darker, the shadows longer. I blinked, and when I opened my eyes, she was gone.<br>
        But I could still feel her presence, lingering in the air, in the silence. In the cold.<br>
        And before I realized she was gone, I heard her voice on my left ear in a manner of whisper, “I love you and I believe it’s the same.”<br>
        And I knew, deep down, that she hadn’t truly left. She never would and I spotted her shadow across the dim walls, following me as I walked around.<br>
        In the distance, the landline rang again, but I didn’t dare answer it.<br>
